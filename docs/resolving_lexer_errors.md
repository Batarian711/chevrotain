## Resolving Lexer Errors

### <a name="LINE_BREAKS"></a> No LINE_BREAKS Error. 

A Chevrotain Lexer will by default track the full position information for each token.
This includes line and column information.

In order to support this the Lexer must be aware of which Tokens may include line terminators.
This information must be provided by the lexer's author.

This error means that the Lexer has been defined to track line and column information (perhaps by default).
Yet not a single one of the Token definitions passed to it was defined as possibly containing line terminators.

To resolve this choose one of the following:

1. Disable the line and column position tracking using the [positionTracking][position_tracking] configuration option.
   ```javascript
   const myTokens = [IntegerLiteral, StringLiteral, WhiteSpace /*, ... */]
   const myLexer = new chevrotain.Lexer([myTokens], {
      positionTracking: "onlyOffset" 
   })
   ```
   
2. Mark the Tokens which may include a line terminator with a line_breaks flag.
   ```javascript
    const createToken = chevrotain.createToken
    
    // Using createToken API
    const Whitespace = createToken({
        name: "Whitespace",
        pattern: /\s+/,
        line_breaks: true
    })
    
    // or in ES2015 syntax with static properties
    class Whitespace extends chevrotain.Token {}
    Whitespace.PATTERN = /\s+/
    Whitespace.LINE_BREAKS = true
    
    const myTokens = [IntegerLiteral, StringLiteral, WhiteSpace /*, ... */]
    
    const myLexer = new chevrotain.Lexer([myTokens])
   ```
   
   - Note that the definition of what constitutes a line terminator is controlled by the
     [lineTerminatorsPattern][line_terminator_docs] lexer configuration property.
   
   - Also note that multi-line tokens such as some types of comments and string literals tokens may contain
     line terminators, if your language includes such tokens they must also be marked with the line_breaks flag.
   
   
   
### <a name="ANCHORS"></a> Unexpected RegExp Anchor Error.

A Token RegExp pattern used in a chevrotain lexer may not use the start/end of input anchors ('$' and '^').

```javascript
const createToken = chevrotain.createToken
    
// Using createToken API
const Whitespace = createToken({
    name: "Integer",
    // invalid pattern using both anchors
    pattern: /^\d+$/
})
``` 

This will be checked for during the initialization of the lexer.
Unfortunately, this validation can detect false positives when the anchor characters
are used in certain regExp contexts, for example:

```javascript
const createToken = chevrotain.createToken
    
const semVer = createToken({
    name: "semVer",
    // will match semantic versions such as: "1.0.2", "^0.3.9"
    // inside a character set ([...]) the carat ('^') character does not act as an anchor.
    // yet it would still cause the validation to fail.
    pattern: /[~^]?\d+\.\d+\.\d+/
})

// will throw an error
new chevrotain.Lexer([semVer])
``` 

It is possible to workaround this problem by simply **escaping** the the offending carat or dollar sign.

```javascript
const semVer = createToken({
    name: "semVer",
    pattern: /[~\^]?\d+\.\d+\.\d+/
})
```

# examples_ecma5_typescript

An example of using Chevrotain to parse ECMAScript 5.1.
The Lexer is hand built and is based upon Esprima's lexer implementation.
The Parser is built using Chevrotain and written in Typescript.

This example is still a work in progress and thus it is not perfectly aligned to the spec yet...

To run this example:

1. ```npm update```
2. ```npm test```

To view the syntax Diagrams additional setup steps are needed:
1. ```npm install -g bower```
2. ```bower update```

Now open ```ecma5_diagrams.html``` in your favorite browser.

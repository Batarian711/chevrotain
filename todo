BUILD/RELEASE/HIGH PRIORITY
1. replace jshashtable with hashtable
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/hashtable as it supports umd and is both on bower and npm.

2. remove .js from libs, load the relevant js files from node_modules instead

3. compile specs + examples + examples specs as individual files and (aggregate)? them + umd + dependencies to chevrotain
   * probably need to run in all 3 manners amd/node/globals to properly test...

4. coverage as part of build? find a plugin that puts a low bound on coverage?

5. finish readme.md

6. bower release.

7. npm release.

BLOCKED:
* travis integration for CI (needs to be on github first)


FEATURES:
* DSL for lookahead
* lookahead validations
* semantic validations on grammar (no duplicate CONSUME1 for example)


EXAMPLES:
* html with live diagrams (maybe firas can help?)

BUGS:
* fix rule name validation to take into account the parser constructor name.
